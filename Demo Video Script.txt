Hello, my name is Thorsten.
In this video, I would like to introduce a software called Places.

Places is a desktop application, which runs in the background.
It can be activated at any time with the keyboard or mouse.

This is, how it looks like.

The main philosophy behind Places is, that if you once place an icon in a position,
it will stay there for always.
That is, why the program carries its name.
You can freely position icons, and Places will never re-arrange or sort them,
even if you change the screen resolution. Instead the icons are scaled accordingly.

Let me demonstrate this by dragging the task bar.

Because you will find the icons always at the same position, Places enables you to 
launch programs as quickly as possible without thinking or searching.

Also the number of columns and rows can be changed in the settings.

------------------- BREAK -----------------------
I am a software developer, and as a heavy-user I need to launch many different programs
at different times.

So my main design goal for Places was, to be able to launch applications as quickly as
possible with the least number of mouse clicks or key strokes.

As a result, I decided that icons have to stay always in the same position where you 
once placed them, so they can be located quickly and without thinking.

My second design decision was, that the icon's positions can be specified freely.
Places does no dictate where icons are positioned, and it does not re-arrange them.

That is, why the program carries its name: everything stays always in the same place.
[As a result, places enables you to launch programs as quickly as possible.]

------------------- BREAK -----------------------

In the following, I will give a quick demonstration what can be done with places.
You do not need to memorize the keyboard and mouse commands, they are listed in detail
in the readme-file, which is installed together with Places.
To get the most out of Places, I recommend to read it.

As you can see, I arranged my icons in groups with a functional structure
- this are for example software development tools
- and this group represents tools for editing bitmaps and graphics

On the second page I have placed tools for making music, and on the third page are 
less often used tools and games.

Places provides a total of ten pages.
You can scroll through the pages in different ways:
- by dragging with the mouse
- using the scroll wheel of the mouse
- by clicking onto the page indicators
- entering a digit from one to zero on the keyboard

Places can be moved into background by:
- clicking into the free space
- pressing the escape key

------------------- BREAK -----------------------

Working with icons:

- adding icons
	- Fullscreen mit Explorer Fenster im Vordergrund ==> add exe
	- Windowed Mode ==> add document
	- right click on blank area "new icon": demo facebook-http-link, mit icon download
	- reload icons
- short left-click onto icon: open / execute
- moving icons
- moving icons to another page
- icon properties ==> change title or icon
- delete
- ctrl + click, select multiple icons
- lasso
		special: add-select (shift + alt) and subtract-deselect (ctrl + alt)
				if the lasso covers and then un-covers icons, their previous state is restored!
- undo / redo


------------------- BREAK -----------------------
Let's take a look at the settings dialog.

With a right click you can choose settings.

- The top area defines how to activate Places.
- I have a five button mouse, and I can always actrivate Places with a single click onto a special button.

- In the next part you can define the background.
- Shaders are very interesting. They are small programs which directly run on your graphics card and allow interesting effects.
- Places installs several shaders, which were written by other people.
  If you open a shader file with notepad, you can see the name of its author.
- My favorite is ether.
- Under water
- Fire

- Background image

- fixed color

I will switch back to fixed color, because the animated background makes video compression much less efficient and
would cause this video stream to become much bigger and to require much more bandwidth.

- Rows / columns

- hochsetzen

- Resize Taskbar

- zurück auf 15 x 7

------------------- BREAK -----------------------

- Thanks for watching and have a nice day.

As a result, a fundamental design decision was, that icons always stay in the same position where they once were placed,
regardless of the screen resolution and other factors.

The second design decision was, that icons can be placed freely in any position, so the user defines by himself the icon layout.
When a new icon is added, or if icons are moved or deleted, the positions of all other icons remain unaffected.
	

	- this is what it looks like after a fresh installation
	
		- default icons, will be german on german windows
		
		- installed automatically as autostart
	
	- what is places good for?

	- one problem: show desktop with many open windows, now accessing a desktop icon is impossible
		- the hide all windows button is useless (show in video)
		
	- second problem most of you are aware of: changing the screen resolution
		- Windows re-arranges the icons at will
		- Places scales the icons, they stay in their position
			==> simulation: resize and reposition taskbar

	Design Goals
	-   Starting applications or opening folder-/ file links as quick as possible with the least number of user interactions
		(i.e. mouse clicks, pressing keys).

	-   Everything stays in its place: icons will always stay in the same position, where you once placed them.

		- there is no sorting or re-ordering

		- and it is screen resolution independent: if the resolution changes, the icons do not change their positions, 
			they are scaled up or down in size as required
			
		As a result you will always find your icons at the same position with a quick mouse click.

		==> that is why the program has its name: everything stays always in the same place

		==> and Places runs in the background and can be activated through several different methods while working with other programs
	
	- recommend reading "readme.txt", lists all keyboard shortcuts and mouse functions and contains 
		additional useful information to get the best out of places. It also explains where the database file is located,
		if you wish to create backups.
		
==> Short BREAK: in the following I will use my personal setup
- VORBEREITEN: IDEAL Software Icon weg
		- how to activate
			- taskbar click icon
			- define keyboard shortcut
			- define mouse button
			- move mouse into right-top corner
			- double-click into free desktop space
			
		- how to close
			- left click onto blank area
			- ESC key
			
	- Settings Dialog + Shaders
		==> bei 1920 x 1200 kann man 16 x 8 statt 16 x 7 icon layout wählen
		
	- add icons
		- windowed mode und draggen
			- it is also possible to drag a folder or a file into places ==> vorführen
			- geht auch vom startmenü
			- Pitfall: if you drag a link (for example from the desktop), and you later delete the original link from the desktop,
			  the icon in places will no longer work. i.e. nothing will happen if you click onto it. This is so, because the icon
			  in Places will point to a non-existing link.

		- short left-click onto icon: open / execute
		- long left-click onto icon: select
		- ctrl + left-click onto icon: select / deselect; other selected icons stay selected
		- right-click onto icon to choose between "properties" or "remove"
			- properties ==> change title or icon
		- left-click onto selected icon(s) and drag the mouse: move selected icon(s)
		
		- right click on blank area "new icon": demo facebook-http-link, mit icon download
		- reload icons
		
	- mouse scrolling
		- drag
		- scroll wheel
		- navbuttons on bottom
		- keyboard digits
		- screen up / down
		
	- Lasso
		special: add-select (shift + alt) and subtract-deselect (ctrl + alt)
				if the lasso covers and then un-covers icons, their previous state is restored!
				
	- move icon(s)
		- move to another page
		==> what it means if icons are moved back
		
	- undo / redo
