# Places: Windows Application Launcher


## Design Goals
Starting applications or opening folder-/ file links as quickly as possible with a minimum number of user interactions (i.e. mouse clicks, key presses).

Everything stays in its place: icons will always stay in the same position, where you once placed them. No sorting, no re-ordering, no changes if the resolution of the screen changes. Instead, the icons are scaled accordingly to the screen resolution. You will always find your icons at the same position with a quick mouse click. Therefore the name "Places".

## Eye-Candy and Smooth
 - animated icons
 - animated smooth scrolling between pages
 - bitmaps for icons can be loaded from external files
 - use shaders, patterns or images as background wallpaper
    
## Intuitive and fast user interface
 - Places is moved to the front of the screen and is not hidden by other windows
 - unlimited undo and redo (ctrl + z, ctrl + y)
 - Lasso to select and de-select groups of items (alt + left-click to drag lasso, groups of icons can be arranged or moved to other pages)
 - provides a total of 10 pages
 - special windowed mode, also useful to drag apps and folders into "Places"
 - wipe to scroll between pages
 - several activation methods to activate / hide Places (5-button mouse recommended)
 - activation can be suspended, when a full-screen app is running in foreground, e.g. a game

## System Requirements
 - Windows Vista or higher
 - Graphics Card with OpenGL driver (i.e. any modern Graphics Card)
